This is a test file with some referenced equations, line
\begin{equation}{ this }\end{equation}

Some equations might be inside of text,
\begin{equation}{ for example }\end{equation} this one.

Some equations might be on start of paragraphs:

\begin{equation}{ start }\end{equation} of paragraph.

Other might be on separate paragraphs of their own:

\begin{equation}{ separate }\end{equation}

Some of those can be labelled:

This is a test file with some referenced equations, line
\begin{equation}\protect\phantomsection\label{eq:0}{ this }\end{equation}

Some equations might be inside of text,
\begin{equation}\protect\phantomsection\label{eq:1}{ for example }\end{equation}
this one.

Some equations might be on start of paragraphs:

\begin{equation}\protect\phantomsection\label{eq:2}{ start }\end{equation}
of paragraph.

Other might be on separate paragraphs of their own:

\begin{equation}\protect\phantomsection\label{eq:3}{ separate }\end{equation}

Then they can be referenced:

Individually eq.~\ref{eq:0}, eq.~\ref{eq:1}, eq.~\ref{eq:2},
eq.~\ref{eq:3}

Or in groups eqns.~\ref{eq:0}, \ref{eq:1}, \ref{eq:3}

Groups will be compacted
eqns.~\ref{eq:0}, \ref{eq:1}, \ref{eq:3}, \ref{eq:2}
