title: pandoc-crossref demo document
---

This is a demo file for pandoc-crossref. With this filter, you can cross-reference figures (see [@fig:figure1;@fig:figure2;@fig:figure3]), display equations (see @eq:eqn1), tables (see [@tbl:table1]) and sections ([@sec:sec1; @sec:sec2; @sec:caption-attr; @sec:table-capts; @sec:wrapping-div])

For immediate example, see @fig:figure0

![A figure](img1.jpg){#fig:figure0}

There is also support for code blocks, for example, [@lst:captionAttr; @lst:tableCaption; @lst:wrappingDiv]

It's possible to capitalize reference prefixes, like this: [@Fig:figure1].

In case of multiple references, capitalization is determined by first reference. [@Fig:figure1; @fig:figure2] is capitalized, while [@fig:figure2; @Fig:figure1] is not.

It is also possible to mix different references, like [@fig:figure1; @tbl:table1; @lst:captionAttr; @lst:tableCaption; @fig:figure2; @fig:figure3], which will be grouped in order they are specified. You can even intermix this with regular citations, although it's not recommended: [@fig:figure1; @tbl:table1; @unprocessedCitation]

You can also have custom chapter reference labels, like @sec:custlabs

Subfigures are supported, see [@fig:subfigures; @fig:subfigureB]

# Figures {#sec:sec1}

![First figure](img1.jpg){#fig:figure1}

![Second figure](img2.jpg){#fig:figure2}

![Third figure](img3.jpg){#fig:figure3}

![Unlabelled image](img1.jpg)

<div id="fig:subfigures">
![Subfigure a](img1.jpg)

![Subfigure b](img1.jpg){#fig:subfigureB}

\: Subfigures caption. []{}
</div>

# Equations {#sec:sec2}

Display equations are labelled and numbered

$$ P_i(x) = \sum_i a_i x^i $$ {#eq:eqn1}

Since 0.1.6.0 those can also appear in the middle of paragraph
$$a x^2 + b x^2 + c = 0$${#eq:quadr} like this.

# Tables

| First Header | Second Header |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

: Table example {#tbl:table1}

Table without caption:

| First Header | Second Header |
|:-------------|:--------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

# Code blocks

There are a couple options for code block labels. Those work only if code block id starts with `lst:`, e.g. `{#lst:label}`

## `caption` attribute {#sec:caption-attr}

`caption` attribute will be treated as code block caption. If code block has both id and `caption` attributes, it will be treated as numbered code block.

```{#lst:captionAttr .haskell caption="Listing caption"}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```

\pagebreak

## Table-style captions  {#sec:table-capts}

Enabled with `codeBlockCaptions` metadata option. If code block is immediately
adjacent to paragraph, starting with `Listing: ` or `: `, said paragraph will be
treated as code block caption.

Listing: Listing caption

```{#lst:tableCaption .haskell}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```

## Wrapping div

Wrapping code block without label in a div with id `lst:...` and class, starting with `listing`, and adding paragraph after code block, but inside div, starting with `:` will treat said paragraph as code block caption.

<div id="lst:wrappingDiv" class="listing">
```{.haskell}
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```
: Listing caption
</div>

# Unnumbered chapter. {-}

This chapter doesn't change chapter prefix of referenced elements, instead keeping number of previous chapter, e.g.
$$ S(x) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} a x+b \  \mathrm{d}x $$ {#eq:eqn2}

# Reference lists

It's also possible to show lists of figures and tables, like this:

\listof{fig}

\listof{tbl}

\listof{lst}

# Custom labels {label=A title=Appendix}

## This section will have custom label {#sec:custlabs label=I}
